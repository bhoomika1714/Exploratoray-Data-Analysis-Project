# Exploratoray-Data-Analysis-Project
**The WiDS  Datathon  2024 focuses on predicting the metastatic diagnosis period for patients who have been diagnosed with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The goal is to develop predictive models to estimate the period (in days) between the diagnosis of breast cancer and the diagnosis of metastatic cancer.**

## Objectives
Understand and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical         variables, and normalize features appropriately.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, relationships, and feature importance related to the target variable.
Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict the probability of the Diagnosis Period being less than 90 days, using performance metrics for optimization.
